### Branding Page

In order to signify a brand name from a company, we developed the Branding Page. Here you can show people what it is like working for a company, without interfering with the marketing for collections for that company. Also other information about the company, such as its different labels, statistics, history, video or images, it's all possible.

Examples: [Adidas](https://fashionunited.uk/adidas), [Veldhoven](http://www.fashionunited.nl/veldhovengroup/), [Peek & Cloppenburg](http://www.fashionunited.de/pc%11Peek%11Cloppenburg/), [Grupo Cortefiel](http://www.fashionunited.es/grupo-cortefiel).

Images supplied need to be high resolution 300dpi and can be supplied in JPG, PDF, TIFF, GIF format. Logo's are best supplied in SVG format. (see > SVG logo)
