**Jobs Push API V2** enables you to _post_, _update_, and _unpublish_ jobs on the FashionUnited platform. We also provide the possibility to _retrieve_ existing jobs from our database for verification purposes. We support both [JSON](/docs/jobs-v2/json) and [XML](/docs/jobs-v2/xml) format but **we recommend using the JSON format.** Our API follows the [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) principles and implements full [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) functionality. The [JSON](/docs/jobs-v2/json) and [XML](/docs/jobs-v2/xml) APIs are identical, the only difference is the representation of jobs.
